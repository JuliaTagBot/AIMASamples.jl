This package is developed by the author as a sample program development of
Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach 3rd Edition. This is not the
official sample program source for the book. The solution here is just the
author's own interpretation and does not have any dependency or ratification
from any work carried out as part of the official sample code available at:
[aimacode](https://github.com/aimacode). Anyone interested in the official
version may visit the link provided

This sample program library is built as a Julia package which can be loaded into
 the Julia runtime easily.
